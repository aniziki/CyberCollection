Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

## How does XSS work?

Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.

## XSS proof of concept

You can confirm most kinds of XSS vulnerability by injecting a payload that causes your own browser to execute some arbitrary JavaScript. It's long been common practice to use the `alert()` function for this purpose because it's short, harmless, and pretty hard to miss when it's successfully called. In fact, you solve the majority of our XSS labs by invoking `alert()` in a simulated victim's browser.

Unfortunately, there's a slight hitch if you use Chrome. From version 92 onward (July 20th, 2021), cross-origin iframes are prevented from calling `alert()`. As these are used to construct some of the more advanced XSS attacks, you'll sometimes need to use an alternative PoC payload. In this scenario, we recommend the `print()` function. If you're interested in learning more about this change and why we like `print()`, [check out our blog post](https://portswigger.net/research/alert-is-dead-long-live-print) on the subject.

As the simulated victim in our labs uses Chrome, we've amended the affected labs so that they can also be solved using `print()`. We've indicated this in the instructions wherever relevant.

## What are the types of XSS attacks?

There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are:

- [[Reflected XSS]], where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
- [[Stored XSS]], where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
- [[DOM-based XSS]], where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.
## What can XSS be used for?

An attacker who exploits a cross-site scripting vulnerability is typically able to:

- Impersonate or masquerade as the victim user.
- Carry out any action that the user is able to perform.
- Read any data that the user is able to access.
- Capture the user's login credentials.
- Perform virtual defacement of the web site.
- Inject trojan functionality into the web site.

## Impact of XSS vulnerabilities

The actual impact of an XSS attack generally depends on the nature of the application, its functionality and data, and the status of the compromised user. For example:

- In a brochureware application, where all users are anonymous and all information is public, the impact will often be minimal.
- In an application holding sensitive data, such as banking transactions, emails, or healthcare records, the impact will usually be serious.
- If the compromised user has elevated privileges within the application, then the impact will generally be critical, allowing the attacker to take full control of the vulnerable application and compromise all users and their data.

## How to find and test for XSS vulnerabilities

The vast majority of XSS vulnerabilities can be found quickly and reliably using Burp Suite's web vulnerability scanner.

Manually testing for reflected and stored XSS normally involves submitting some simple unique input (such as a short alphanumeric string) into every entry point in the application, identifying every location where the submitted input is returned in HTTP responses, and testing each location individually to determine whether suitably crafted input can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript. In this way, you can determine the [context](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts) in which the XSS occurs and select a suitable payload to exploit it.

Manually testing for DOM-based XSS arising from URL parameters involves a similar process: placing some simple unique input in the parameter, using the browser's developer tools to search the DOM for this input, and testing each location to determine whether it is exploitable. However, other types of DOM XSS are harder to detect. To find DOM-based vulnerabilities in non-URL-based input (such as `document.cookie`) or non-HTML-based sinks (like `setTimeout`), there is no substitute for reviewing JavaScript code, which can be extremely time-consuming. Burp Suite's web vulnerability scanner combines static and dynamic analysis of JavaScript to reliably automate the detection of DOM-based vulnerabilities.

## How to prevent XSS attacks

Preventing cross-site scripting is trivial in some cases but can be much harder depending on the complexity of the application and the ways it handles user-controllable data.

In general, effectively preventing XSS vulnerabilities is likely to involve a combination of the following measures:

- **Filter input on arrival.** At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input.
- **Encode data on output.** At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.
- **Use appropriate response headers.** To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the `Content-Type` and `X-Content-Type-Options` headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend.
- **Content Security Policy.** As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.
