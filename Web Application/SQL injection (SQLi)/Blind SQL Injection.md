Blind SQL injection is a type of SQL injection where the attacker does not receive an abvious response from the attacked database and instead reconstructs the database structure step-by-step by observing the behavior of the database server and the application.

There are two types of blind SQL injections: 
- [[Boolean-Based SQL Injection]]
- [[Time-Based Blind SQL Injection]]
