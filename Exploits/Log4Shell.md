## Description: 
An attacker performs an HTTP request against a target system, which generates a log using Log4j 2 that leverages [JNDI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/overview/index.html) to perform a request to the attacker-controlled site. The vulnerability then causes the exploited process to reach out to the site and execute the payload.
