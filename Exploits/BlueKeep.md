# BlueKeep
**Description:** BlueKeep affects Windows XP through Windows Server 2008. A use after free ([UAF](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/use-after-free/)) condition exists within the [termdd.sys](https://www.reviversoft.com/en/processes/termdd.sys) RDP kernel driver. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by establishing an RDP connection to the target server, opening an MS_T120 virtual channel, and sending crafted data to it. Successful exploitation will result in the attacker executing arbitrary code with kernel-level privileges or causing a denial-of-service
