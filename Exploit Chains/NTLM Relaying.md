## **Description:** 
In a NTLM relay attack, an attacker establishes a position between the client and server on the network and intercepts [[SMB]] authentication traffic. Client authentication requests are forwarded to the server by the attacker, similarly challenges are relayed to the client and valid authentication responses to the challenge from the client are sent back to the server, allowing the attacker—rather than the client—to authenticate using the client’s credentials.
